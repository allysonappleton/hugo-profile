    title: "About Me"
    image: /images/hero.svg
    content: |-
      I am a fourth year Cognitive Science of Language at McMaster University. Being in this program has allowed me to explore my interests while also being able to develop valuable skills. 
      My interests include language acquisition (L1 and L2), corpus linguistics, as well as linguistic and speech analysis. 
      
      **The potential audience of my portfolio** are fellow McMaster students, such those in [Cognitive Science of Language](https://linguistics.humanities.mcmaster.ca/undergraduate-programs/cognitive-science-of-language/) or [Linguistics](https://linguistics.humanities.mcmaster.ca/undergraduate-programs/linguistics/) program. I am also interested in my portfolio being viewed by future employers and graduate schools!
      
      **The goal of my portfolio** is provide resources to linguists who are interested in speech and language analysis, through softwares such as Praat.
      
      I would like to include **programs** that will analyze speech and phonetic data from Praat. As well as, functions that will make data analyses more convenient for linguists.
